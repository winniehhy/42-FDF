# FDF ( only for linux)
FdF is a project in which we convert a file with a grid of height values into a 3d wireframe using a simple graphics library called MiniLibX.

-> Things to learn
- Minilibx documentation and library
- Parsing map data by determining the dimension and clearing map
- Drawing line algorithm (Bresenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm)
- Isometric projection Matrix
- RGB color transition
